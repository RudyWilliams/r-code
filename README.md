# R Code
Contains the code that I write as I go through the [Introduction to 
Statistical Learning textbook](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) 
along with the code I write for homework assignments (in the future).

A lot of the code is taken from the above textbook, but I try to play with it a bit for the purpose of learning. This repo is mostly a reference for my studying.
